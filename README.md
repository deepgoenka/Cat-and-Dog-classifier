## Features
- Classifies images as either "Cat" or "Dog."
- Utilizes a neural network architecture for image classification.
- Provides a user-friendly interface for image classification.
- Includes the ability to visualize classification results and model performance.

## Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing images of cats and dogs, which can be found [here](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip). The dataset is split into training and testing sets, making it suitable for training and evaluating the model.

## Installation
To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended).
4. Activate the virtual environment:
  - On Windows:
    ```
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On macOS and Linux:
    ```
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. Install the required packages.
6. Run the application.
   
## Usage
Once the project is set up, you can use it to classify images as cats or dogs by following these steps:
1. Upload an image containing a cat or a dog.
2. Run the cell for prediction to get the classification result.

## Model Training
To understand how the neural network model was trained and explore the architecture used, refer to the model training section in the documentation.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the image classification model and understand its accuracy, consult the evaluation section in the documentation.
